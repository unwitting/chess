# Playing black vs 1. e4

## Alekhine's Defence 1... Nf6

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alekhine's_Defence):

> Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence

It's roughly 50/50 so far that I've come across the following two moves from white: they accept the idea, push e5 to chase the knight and build a more advanced pawn structure (main line), or they bring out their own knight with Nc3. In database games, e5 is twice as common as Nc3 and is almost perfectly split between white / black wins.

## Main Line 2. e5 Nd5

Only really one response here, which is nice: Nd5. It's the obvious one, so it's easy to remember, and it's solid in database games. This is almost the unanimous response to e5 (though interestingly, Ng8 has been played and led to reasonably even win splits: it's called the Brooklyn Variation).

The vast majority of the time, white will follow up with a pawn move either on d or c.

## 3. d4

More common than c4, white's looking to build a bigger pawn centre.

## 3...d6 4. c4 Nb6

If you play the main line against this (3...d6), we branch: white will either bring out c4 and then f4 to try and form the **Four Pawns Attack**: the pointy central wall of pawns that tries to smother development, or they'll accept the offered exd6 (still following c4) in what's called the **Exchange Variation**. In doing this, they give up the seriously forward pawn structure in the hopes of actually holding onto the central one they do have.

Note that in either case, white's fourth move is normally the intermediate 4. c4 Nb6 as a setup.

## Exchange Variation 5. exd6

We retake with the King's pawn exd6, and then usually black's knights start developing and we attempt to castle kingside with Be7. Pretty solid, even game from here.

## Four Pawns Variation / Attack 5. f4

White decides to take you up on the main premise of the Alekhine's Defence and gobble up space, betting that they can use it and hold it before you can use it against them. The point is you need to be very forthright and not passive: if you give white too much time they'll consolidate and you'll have no space at all.

Throw the first pawn in with dxe5, they'll normally recapture with fxe5, then you're bringing out your second knight to attack the pawns, and then slipping your bishop out to Bf5 before closing the door behind it with e6.

After that, same as before: second bishop out to e7 and castle kingside.

## O'Sullivan Gambit 3...b5 4. Bxb5 c5

This is a bold one and will porbably be very unprepared for: you offer the b pawn to white's bishop, then push c5 as well, threatening Qa5+, attacking the bishop. Often they'll then either c4 or Bc4 to attack the knight: give them that too and shield the action from their queen with cxd4. They have to be very careful or more will fall on their queenside beyond just the bishop being recaptured.

This gets tactical but shapes that often come up are to bring bishop to Ba6 behind the queen, or X-raying a queen on d5 with Bb7, attacking the kingside rook.
